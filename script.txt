I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Mind saying that again?
Hi, what is your name?
How old are you?
Well, that's pretty young. When is your birthday?
Wow! That's my birthday! Where were you born?
I don't believe it. I was born there too! What's your favourite colour?
This is rediculous! That's my favourite colour too. Is there no end to the madness! How tall are you?
Huh. No. I'm not that tall. In fact, I've no height at all. What are your parent's names?
Huh, weird. Where are they from?
Not a nice place. Have you been there?  
Was it nice?
Maybe I'll go there. What do you think of my voice?
OK, that's enough, bye!
What do you like?
Go suck an egg.
Do you wear glasses?
What else can I say?
Wait. Oh my God. Is that rude?
